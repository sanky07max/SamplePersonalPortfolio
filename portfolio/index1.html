          <h2>Python</h2>
          <p>Our customers are building useful services using our webhook feature—but unfortunately, others are not. Often we hear that no one on their team is proficient enough to write a service that can ingest a webhook payload and do something with the data. That leaves them either hoping to get cycles from their development team (unlikely) or continuing to do without.</p>

            <h2>One-page layout</h2>
            <p>This project aims to recreate a pixel perfect design and make a one-page responsive layout. This is also a beginner-level project that allows freshers to test their newly acquired knowledge and skill level.You can use the Conquer template to build this project. This template comes loaded with a host of unique layouts. Also, it brings before you a series of challenges that Web Developers often face in real-world scenarios. As a result, you are pushed to experiment with new technologies like Floats and Flexbox to hone the implementation of CSS layout techniques. </p>

            <h2>Titanic survival Project</h2>
            <p>This is a beginner’s project on Kaggle that is best for you if you are just getting started with ML projects. This deals with the Titanic disaster that is one of the most famous in marine history. All you have to do in the project is predict which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck based on data such as their age, gender, socio-economic class, etc. For example, it is highly probable that someone rich from the first-class survived as compared to someone from the third class. You can use the Titanic dataset on Kaggle for this project. And just to make things more interesting, this dataset contains real data based on the people who died and survived the actual Titanic disaster.</p>

            <p>On the internet, plagiarism is widespread. The internet is brimming with content, which can be found on millions of different websites. It can be tough to tell which content is plagiarised and which is not at times. Authors of blog postings should check to see if their work has been stolen and put elsewhere. News organizations should investigate whether a content farm has stolen their news pieces and claimed them as their own. The task is demanding. What if you had your own plagiarism detection software? This opportunity is provided by AI.</p>

            <h2>Automate Google Search using Selenium</h2>
            <p>Google search can be automated using Python script in just 2 minutes. This can be done using selenium (a browser automation tool). Selenium is a portable framework for testing web applications. It can automatically perform the same interactions that any you need to perform manually and this is a small example of it. Mastering Selenium will help you automate your day to day tasks like controlling your tweets, Whatsapp texting and even just googling without actually opening a browser in just 15-30 lines of python code. The limits of automation is endless with selenium.</p>
